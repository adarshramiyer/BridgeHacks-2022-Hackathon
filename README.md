# Meso: BridgeHacks 2022

According to Steve Prentice, Director of Software Development at Cisco, 98% of post-covid meetings will have at least one remote participant. And Mithun Baphana, Senior Product Manager at Cisco, says that this poses a serious challenge to companies trying to retain talent and build an inclusive work environment. It is also difficult for employees to manage several unconnected resources.

*Enter meso.*

Meso is your one-stop-shop to efficient, connected, and memorable hybrid work. Maintaining organization, employee spirit, and company vision has never been easier.

This is achieved through three features:

**Calendar**

Meso incorporates an intuitive calendar page which utilizes the Google Calendar API for portability. Additionally, we support convenient voice scheduling using speech-to-text and Natural Language Processing.

**Employee Resources**

Our Natural Language Processing Chatbot, SunShine, helps employees with routine People and Communities tasks and mental health concerns. We believe that this technology helps People and Communities focus on driving business strategy and delivering shareholder value.

**Team Bonding**

No company is complete without a strong collaborative spirit. Meso offers several team bonding activities to lighten spirits, build team connections, and assist in employee retention.
